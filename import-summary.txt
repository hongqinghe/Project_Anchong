ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From LargeImage-lib:
* .gitignore
* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt
From android-gesture-detectors-lib:
* .gitignore

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In android-gesture-detectors-lib:
* AndroidManifest.xml => androidgesturedetectorslib/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* src/ => androidgesturedetectorslib/src/main/java/
In LargeImage-lib:
* AndroidManifest.xml => largeImagelib/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/commons-lang3-3.4.jar => largeImagelib/libs/commons-lang3-3.4.jar
* src/ => largeImagelib/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
